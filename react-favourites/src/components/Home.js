        Welcome to the swapi, the Star Wars API! This documentation should help
        you familiarise yourself with the resources available and how to consume
        them with HTTP requests. If you're after a native helper library then I
        suggest you scroll down and check out what's available. Read through the
        getting started section before you dive in. Most of your problems should
        be solved just by reading through it.
