# Star Wars Api Examples

Every abstraction is a lie. Hello World examples are not something that we can raly on when picking up technology we would like to learn. If implementation begin to be camplicated enough some technologies/tools shines some of them begin to be tedious to maintain.

The main goal of this repository is to create examples complex enough to show real problems.

Paging is simple thing to implement so lets add some filtering, sorting, real api requests and some inevitable error handlers.

Persit user data in some cloud service should be fun but what if we decide to allow users to work offline?
